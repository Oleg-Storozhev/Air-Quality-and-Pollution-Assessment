# **Air Quality Analysis and Classification**

This project is part of a series of Kaggle competitions. The goal is to analyze and classify the quality of air based on various pollution metrics.

### Dataset

The project uses a dataset taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mujtabamatin/air-quality-and-pollution-assessment/data.). It contains a range of air quality indicators, collated from various locations, and various times of the year.

### Objective

To create an accurate predictive model that can classify the quality of air as 'Good' or 'Dangerous' based on these parameters. The main challenge is to deal with "mixed" data where all columns would indicate good air quality, yet the target label is 'dangerous'.

### Approach

Our approach to solving this problem takes into account the knowledge we have about the mixed nature of the data. We devote a substantial amount of time to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering. By understanding our data better through EDA, we can identify which features have the most influence on air quality and then engineer these features to serve as strong predictors in our classification model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA is crucial for understanding the connections, and potential collinearity, among the features. We carefully inspect all variables to identify gaps, missing values, and outliers. We employ various visualization techniques to understand the distribution and relationship of features.

### Feature Engineering

We believe that wise feature engineering can chart the path to a robust model. Keeping this in mind, we scrupulously engineer the features based on the insights generated from the EDA. The engineered features will improve the model's predictive power by exposing new information or clarifying the relationship between specific features and the target variable.
Development and Training of Classification Model
Once feature engineering is done, we proceed to model development and training. We experiment with various classification algorithms, evaluate their performance, and tune them to improve the accuracy of predictions.

### Technologies and Tools Used

This project is developed using Python, with the coding and analysis work done in a Jupyter notebook.

We're making use of the following packages:
* Pandas: Used for data handling and manipulation.
* NumPy: Employed for mathematical operations.
* matplotlib and seaborn: Used for data visualization to understand the data and the relationships between different features.
* scikit-learn: Provides various tools for model selection, training, and evaluation. Specifically, the train_test_split function is used to split our dataset into training and test sets, accuracy_score to evaluate the performance of our model, and classification_report for a detailed performance analysis.
* xgboost.XGBClassifier: This is the machine learning model that we use for the task of classification. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance.

### Conclusion

This project addresses the challenge of predicting air quality based on several pollutant indicators amid mixed data. Through the use of meticulous EDA, inventive feature engineering, and the power of machine learning, we strive to create a model that can accurately determine air quality and guide untimely and necessary preventive measures
